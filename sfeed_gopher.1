.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
formats feed data (TSV) from
.Xr sfeed 1
from stdin or for each
.Ar file
to stdout in the raw Gopher output format.
.Pp
If one or more
.Ar file
arguments are specified then the basename of the
.Ar file
is used as the feed name in the output.
.Nm
creates an index file named "index" and for each feed it creates a file with
the same name as the basename of the feed
.Ar file .
.Pp
If no
.Ar file
arguments are specified and so the data is read from stdin then the data is
written to stdout and no files are written.
.Pp
Items with a timestamp from the last day compared to the system time at the
time of formatting are counted and marked as new.
Items are marked as new with the prefix "N".
