.Sh NAME
.Nm sfeed_plain
.Nd format feed data to a plain-text list
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
formats feed data (TSV) from
.Xr sfeed 1
from stdin or for each
.Ar file
to stdout as a plain-text list.
If one or more
.Ar file
arguments are specified then the basename of the
.Ar file
is used as the feed name in the output.
If no
.Ar file
arguments are specified and so the data is read from stdin then the feed name
is empty.
.Pp
Items with a timestamp from the last day compared to the system time at the
time of formatting are marked as new.
Items are marked as new with the prefix "N".
.Pp
.Nm
aligns the output.
It shows a maximum of 70 column-wide characters for the title and outputs
an ellipsis symbol if the title is longer and truncated.
Make sure the environment variable
.Ev LC_CTYPE
is set to a UTF-8 locale, so it can determine the proper column-width
per rune, using
.Xr mbtowc 3
and
.Xr wcwidth 3 .
